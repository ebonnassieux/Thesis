\section{Aims \& Methodology}

\pg
In this section, we describe the work done to make a wide-field image of the entire LOFAR primary beam, centred on EGS. Such a large-field, low-frequency image of this field has never yet been done in this frequency band. Due to technical limitations, the maximum attainable image size (in terms of number of pixels) will limit resolution to about $5''$. As such, the international stations are not used for this part of the project.

\pg
A more complete sky model can be created from this image, allowing for one last round of self-calibration on the 3C295 high-resolution model. Bright out-of-field sources can be subtracted from images of the Extended Groth Strip so that their sidelobes do not contaminate the final images. To achieve this, we require direction-dependent calibration. Because we do not use the international LOFAR stations, we do not use our high-resolution model of 3C295. This ensures that we do not ``hard-set" errors in our high-resolution model caused by other sources in the field. 

\pg
Our methodology is therefore to calibrate the full LOFAR bandwidth using the LOFAR Surveys KSP pipeline (talk about DD calibration, facetting, etc). We then perform source analysis on the most interesting objects in the field, using ancillary data from NVSS \citepads[NRAO VLA Sky Survey, ]{1998AJ....115.1693C}, SDSS \citepads[Sloan Digital Sky Survey, ]{2000AJ....120.1579Y} and WISE \citepads{2010AJ....140.1868W} surveys and cross-referenced using SIMBAD \citepads{2000A&AS..143....9W}. Overlays for those sources will be shown in \cref{sec.lowresEGS.overlays}.

\section{Data Reduction}

%\subsection{Data \& Observation Properties}
%\pg
%The data used to make this image are the same as used to make the high-resolution model of 3C295 in \cref{section.3c295}, but we do not use the visibilities of baselines including international stations in our calibration or imaging. They were acquired through the LOFAR Long-Term Archive service. We do not phase-shift our data when imaging.

\subsection{Calibration Strategy}

\pg
An initial sky model is generated using the VLSSr \citepads[VLA Low-frequency Sky Survey - redux, ]{2012RaSc...47.0K04L}, WENSS \citepads[WEsterbork Northern Sky Survey]{1997A&AS..124..259R} and the NVSS \citepads[NRAO VLA Sky Survey, ]{1998AJ....115.1693C}. This model serves as the basis for facet-based self-calibration, performed using the killMS-DDF surveys pipeline \citepads{2017A&A...598A.104S}.

\caption{\label{fig.EGS.widefield.regions} Full direction-dependent calibrated image of the LOFAR primary beam. Image made without international stations.}
\end{figure}

\pg
The direction-dependent calibration was done using 121 facets, spread as shown in \cref{fig.EGS.widefield.regions}. Some facets converge faster or better than others. Calibration is done solving for full, complex Jones matrices, rather than a physics-based or diagonal-and-rotation matrix [CHECK THAT THIS IS TRUE!].
The final image was imaged with a very small $uv$-cut, keeping only baselines longer than 100m. This is because shorter baselines were not used during calibration, and so discarded for imaging. The image resolution is $1.5''$, and the image was created using both quality-based weighting schemes and Briggs weighting, with a Briggs factor of $-0.5$. This means that the imaging was skewed slightly in favour of uniform weighting (weighting visibilities by local $uv$-density) rather than natural weighting (same weight for all visibilities). Imaging and calibration were done modelling the LOFAR beam, so the image gives integrated flux values rather than apparent flux values. Deconvolution was performed using SSD-clean with an external mask.

\section{Overlays \& Images}\label{sec.lowresEGS.overlays}

\subsection{Selected Sources}

\pg
We select 12 sources in the wide-field image. Our selection is primarily based on whether sources have interesting or peculiar diffuse emission, though some are chosen for being particularly classic examples of radio galaxies. We scan the image from south to north and east to west (scanning upwards then shifting to the right in the image). The source positions are given in \cref{table.egs.sources}.

\end{figure}

\pg
EGS-1 was selected from the wide-field LOFAR image because it showed interesting diffuse structure. \cref{fig.egs1} shows four images: a cutout of the LOFAR image around the source, an SDSS cutout of the same area with the LOFAR image superimposed as an overlay, the same SDSS cutout with an NVSS image overlayed, and finally the same SDSS image again with a WISE image overlay. The first image aims to show why the source was selected. The second shows optical counterparts to LOFAR emission. The third serves to check whether we pick up similar structure and emission in NVSS images as the LOFAR wide-field image. Note that the NVSS images are at a much lower resolution, and are therefore not expected to give any information on LOFAR source structure, but can be a useful way to ensure that we are not choosing artefacts or spurious emission as sources to investigate. Finally, the WISE overlay attempts to see whether infrared emission can be associated to these sources. Note that the sensitivity of SDSS images are not homogeneous: this is because not all patches of the sky have received the same coverage. 

\pg
EGS-1 does not seem to match up to any optical source, nor does it match an infrared source. EGS-1 therefore seems to be best identified as a low-frequency counterpart to NVSS J143706+533225. Its shape seems to include two jets, one much brighter than the other, but both visible in \cref{fig.egs1.lofarim}. This is congruent with a radio galaxy with one Doppler-boosted jet. The absence of an optical counterpart could be due to dust extinction or to insufficient sensitivity.

\end{figure}


\pg
EGS-2 was selected from the wide-field LOFAR image because of the interestingly turbulent morphology of its northern jet, and extended diffuse emission. \cref{fig.egs2} shows four images: a cutout of the LOFAR image around the source, an SDSS cutout of the same area with the LOFAR image superimposed as an overlay, the same SDSS cutout with an NVSS image overlayed, and finally the same SDSS image again with a WISE image overlay. The first image aims to show why the source was selected. The second shows optical counterparts to LOFAR emission. The third serves to check whether we pick up similar structure and emission in NVSS images as the LOFAR wide-field image. Note that the NVSS images are at a much lower resolution, and are therefore not expected to give any information on LOFAR source structure, but can be a useful way to ensure that we are not choosing artefacts or spurious emission as sources to investigate. Finally, the WISE overlay attempts to see whether infrared emission can be associated to these sources. Note that the sensitivity of SDSS images are not homogeneous: this is because not all patches of the sky have received the same coverage. 


\pg
A bright optical source lies very close to the mid-point of EGS-2. This source - 2MASX J14352846+5507519\footnote{\url{http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=\%40499314&Name=2MASX\%20J14352846\%2b5507519&submit=submit}} - is the brightest galaxy in a cluster. It lies at a redshift of 0.13985 \citepads{2013yCat.5139....0A}. Furthermore, there is an NVSS source which seems to nicely overlap the EGS-2: NVSS J143527+550756 \citepads{1998AJ....115.1693C}. These two sources do not seem to be associated in the literature. [reasons why they aren't?] 

\pg
The northern edge of EGS-2's upper jet has interesting morphology: if EGS-2 is indeed associated to the brightest galaxy in the cluster, then this morphology is likely due to differing densities of the intercluster and intracluster media, which the jets will penetrate and interact with in different ways. This morphology is lost on the overlay, and so may not be statistically significant enough to draw conclusions from, however. As ever, because this source lies far from the observation pointing, the sensitivity and calibration are not optimal for analysis: further pointings on EGS-2 might be required to achieve the signal-to-noise required to extract useful information, especially using international LOFAR.

%\clearpage
\subsubsection{EGS-3}

\pg
EGS-3 is one of the most impressive sources in the primary beam.It has very complex diffuse structure. It almost certainly consists of two jets, though the interactions of these jets with the neighbouring medium must be complex indeed. From \cref{fig.egs3.sdss.nvssoverlay}, one can see that the emission can be successfully matched to no less than two individual NVSS sources. In other words, if those NVSS sources are linked to the LOFAR source - and given their spatial distribution, they almost certainly are - then they are two components of a single, deeper structure. The infrared image tells us very little.

\end{subfigure}
\caption{\label{fig.egs3} Images \& Overlays for EGS-3.}
\end{figure}


\pg
Note that an optical source lies along the line linking the two diffuse poles of EGS-3: this source is SDSS J142933.44+544335.2, the brightest galaxy in a cluster. If EGS-3 is a radio galaxy with jet emission, which it almost certainly is (the rough symmetry of the two ``cotton balls" on either side of a ``rod"-like component strongly indicate that this is a very warped jet), then its optical emission must lie somewhere within the ``rod". That this emission would be associated with violent interactions between jet-accelerated particles and ambiant inter-cluster and intra-cluster media seems likely: it would explain the complex, turbulent distribution of emission and the strong ``warping" of the jet structure into the whirls and eddies seen in \cref{fig.egs3.lofarim}. EGS-3 can therefore be fairly unambiguously associated to a galaxy cluster.

\end{subfigure}
\caption{\label{fig.egs4} Images \& Overlays for EGS-4.}
\end{figure}

\pg
Another impressive source, EGS-4 was selected for its complex diffuse structure. Like EGS-3, the structure of this source seems to indicate that it would be a radio jet galaxy within a galaxy cluster. Its LOFAR structure matches the lower-resolution NVSS structure, which is a strong indication that it is not spurious. By the same argument as for EGS-3, we expect this diffuse emission to have associated optical emission somewhere along its central axis. As we can see from \cref{fig.egs4.sdss.nvssoverlay}, EGS-4 can be associated to an NVSS source: NVSS J143137+522728. This radio galaxy lies at redshift 0.292 \citepads{2010ApJ...723.1119L}, and is itself associated to the NVSS source in the middle of EGS-4 and its WISE counterpart. SIMBAD has no further association for this radio galaxy.
Further pointings will be required to acquire more information on this source and its environment.

\caption{\label{fig.egs5} Images \& Overlays for EGS-5.}
\end{figure}

\pg
EGS-5 was chosen due to its size, and was expected to be a very classic radio galaxy. In fact, its lobes were only matched individually. The southern lobe matches to NVSS J142941+510850 \citepads{1997ApJ...475..479W}. The northern lobe matches to NVSS J142954+511147 \citepads{1998AJ....115.1693C}. It is unfortunate that the centre of EGS-5 lies in a region of poor SDSS coverage. Either the original sources are incorrectly identified as individual radio galaxies, and are actually the lobes of a single galaxy, or our analysis of the source is flawed, and we are in fact dealing with two separate sources. The diffuse structure between them in the LOFAR band would seem to indicate that the former case is closer to the truth.

\pg
EGS-6 was also chosen as it seemed like a very standard, classical radio-strong galaxy. There is no match for the centre of EGS-6. The eastern (leftwards) lobe most likely matches NVSS J142608+512921 \citepads{1998AJ....115.1693C}. The western (eastwards) lobe can be matched to SDSS J142558.51+512943.0, but to no NVSS candidate. This is somewhat concerning, as there does seem to be a source in the NVSS overlay at this position, but this source is recorded in neither SIMBAD nor NED.

\pg
EGS-8 was chosen because it is a complex diffuse source. Note that the source to its South is contaminated by a lot of artefacts in the LOFAR image - but that there definitely is a source there, as there is a NVSS counterpart. There is no WISE counterpart to EGS-8. It has two likely candidates for counterparts: first, J141440.4+511743 \citepads{2011A&A...530A..60M}, a radio galaxy lying a few arcseconds to the North of the centre of EGS-8. Second, SDSSCGB 5990 \citepads{2009MNRAS.395..255M}, a compact group of galaxies, which lies a few arcseconds to the South-East. The redshift of both objects are unknown, so it is unclear whether EGS-8 could represent the interaction between both sources, but J141440.4+511743 is likely the host galaxy for EGS-8's radio lobes.

\pg
This source was chosen because it had one strong lobe and one weak: it was expected to be a good example of a radio galaxy with a single doppler-boosted lobe. There is a likely association to the northern lobe: the galaxy cluster CFHT-W CL J141141.7+525450 \citepads{2011ApJ...734...68W}, which lies at $z=.5252$. There is no similarly likely candidate for association with the second lobe, however. It is interesting to note that there is no NVSS equivalent to either lobe.

\pg
The southern source has an NVSS equivalent, but is still dominated by artefacts in the LOFAR image. We therefore do not seek to extract information from this source at the time of writing.

\pg
EGS-10 was selected because its region includes both interesting diffuse emission (EGS-10-1) and what appears to be a very classic example of a radio galaxy (EGS-10-2). EGS-10-1 has a very strong association candidate in 7C 140513.19+551813.00 \citepads{2009yCat.2294....0A}, the brightest galaxy in its cluster. That galaxy lies at a redshift of $z=0.2506(2)$. This association is self-consistent with the association candidates for EGS-3 and EGS-4, which are also very clearly associated with brightest galaxies in their respective galaxy clusters. This seems like a strong indication that such diffuse, turbulent emission is indeed related to the interaction between radio galaxy jets and their surrounding medium. 
EGS-10-2, meanwhile, is likely associated with SDSS J140721.68+550504.5 \citepads{2012MNRAS.421.1569B}, which is also a known radio galaxy. This is consistent with the source being picked up in NVSS. %, and consistent with the intuitive guess that it was a radio-bright galaxy.

\pg
This source was chosen because of its size and very straight jets/lobes. While \cref{fig.egs11.lofarim} shows that there are some artefacts around this source, the general shape seems to be relatively reliable. Interestingly, we can see that each LOFAR lobe is associated with what appear like individual NVSS sources, while the emission between the lobes in the LOFAR band seems to indicate that the sources are connected. The right-hand lobe (westward) is likely associated to NVSS J140304+514453 \citepads{1998AJ....115.1693C}, while the left-hand lobe (eastward) is likely associated with 
NVSS J140323+514440 \citepads{1996AJ....111.1945D}. Unfortunately, no SDSS counterpart is detected.

\pg
No counterpart is found at all for the southern source in any band.

\pg
This source was chosen for its interesting diffuse emission. Identification was straightforward - assuming that this source is a radio-bright galaxy with jet emission, the central blob of the source, surrounded by two others, must be where its center lies. Within this blob lies a single optical counterpart. This counterpart turns out to be SDSS J140243.96+510345.8 \citepads{2009yCat.2294....0A}, the brightest galaxy in its cluster. This is consistent with other similar turbulent diffuse structures chosen in this list: EGS-12's diffuse structure is likely a marker of interactions between the jets of a radio-bright galaxy in a cluster and its surrounding inter-galactic and inter-cluster media.

\pg
No matching was done for the other two radio sources in the field, as they are unresolved and far from the main source of interest, and thus unlikely to be linked. They do, however, have NVSS counterparts, and are thus likely to be true sources.

\section{Discussion}

\pg
The work done in this section had for primary goal to create a decent model of the sky seen by LOFAR's primary beam. To do this, a wide-field, low-resolution image of the fully primary beam was made: this image makes no use of the LOFAR international stations due to technical limitations. Using PyBDSM \citepads{2015ascl.soft02007M}, this model was extracted from an image made after a few rounds of direction-dependent self-calibration.

\pg
However, the scientific value of this image is not limited to its use in imaging the Extended Groth Strip using international LOFAR. Much of the image will not be recreated using the international stations, in part due to computational constraints (simple run time for such a large task) and in part due to technical limitations (performing direction-dependent calibration using international LOFAR would likely require the use of techniques as-of-yet unimplemented in the DDF-kMS pipeline). As such, we look in the large-field image for interesting or unusual sources, and attempt to match them to known sources in other bands in order to learn about them. 12 sources were selected, and the most interesting were consistently matched to brightest galaxies in clusters. This indicates that there are many sources with very interesting diffuse emission in and around the Extended Groth Strip, and some of which merit further observations to better resolve their turbulent structure.

\pg
Further work on this image is of course both possible and highly desirable: the work done here was artisanal, hand-picking sources and associating them individually to equivalents in other bands. Modern survey work, however, requires automation. Applying Bayesian fitting methods to find most likely counterparts to all the sources extracted in the field could yield useful information. However, doing this would require running yet more self-calibration to remove remaining artefacts, whereas our primary aim is to produce a high-resolution map of the Extended Groth Strip, which has the richest multi-frequency coverage and therefore the most likely to give effective matches to all the sources in the field. We therefore do not proceed to do this work on the low-resolution, wide-field image of the Extended Groth Strip and its neighbourhood, but are likely to return to the data to do this at a later date.
