\section{The Low-$\nu$ Sky: Emission Mechanisms}
\pg
This section aims to bring a brief introduction to the emission mechanisms which dominate in the low-frequency sky, and thus of the kind of sources visible to astronomers working in this band. 
write introduction to scientific stuff (e.g. synchrotron radiation, extragalactic fields, etc)
